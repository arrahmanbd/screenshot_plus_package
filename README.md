```
android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
```

If don't add

```
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Take pretty screenshots and save it to the PhotoLibrary.</string>
```

to your `info.plist` file inside `ios/Runner` directory, the application will crash.

## Use

```
import 'package:screenshot_plus/screenshot_plus.dart';
```

and take a screenshot:

```
//Get the absolute path
String path = await ScreenshotPlus.takeShot() ?? '';
debugPrint('Screenshot taken @: $path');
```

In error case the function returns `empty path` to Show the captured image use this widget

```
//image Filepath is the absolute file path
